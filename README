# Proposal: validation error messages in ActiveModel

This stuff is a very rough draft of how I propose to deal with validation
error messages (and potentially other usecases that need I18n support, such as 
form labels).

It might go into Rails or end up in some plugin or gem.

I'm not looking at the actual integration to ActiveModel, yet. So far I'm just 
trying to sketch out the underlying stuff so that it covers all requirements 
in a consistent way.

Requirements:

- Strings in class method calls should be treated as plain text by default
  (might optionally want to treat them as translation keys for gettext-style
  class method calls if requested by the user).
- Symbols in class method calls should be treated as translation keys.
- Use values from class method calls consistently with translation keys that 
  are implicitly built for a validation.
- Different formats (such as :full_message) for the same error should be 
  possible.
- Translation calls should optionally be able to cascade over scopes if 
  requested by the user.

See the tests, especially validation_test.rb
