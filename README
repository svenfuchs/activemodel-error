# Proposal: validation error messages in ActiveModel

This stuff is a very rough draft of how I propose to deal with validation
error messages (and potentially other usecases that need I18n support, such as 
form labels).

It might go into Rails or end up in some plugin or gem.

I'm not looking so much at the actual integration to ActiveModel, yet. So far
I'm just trying to sketch out the underlying stuff so that it covers all
requirements in a consistent way.

I want this stuff to be re-usable in other places where similar patterns occur
when it comes to I18n, such as form labels and potentially other stuff.

Requirements:

- Strings in class method calls should be treated as plain text by default
  (might optionally want to treat them as translation keys for gettext-style
  class method calls if requested by the user).
- Symbols in class method calls should be treated as translation keys.
- Use values from class method calls consistently with translation keys that 
  are implicitly built for a validation.
- Different translation variants (such as :full_message) for the same message
  should be possible.
- Translation calls should optionally be able to cascade over scopes if 
  requested by the user.
- Support format strings, e.g. "{{attribute}} {{message}}"
